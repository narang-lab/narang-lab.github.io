[{"content":" Challenge and Opportunity # Excited-state nanophotonics presents a critical challenge and opportunity as it involves competing degrees of freedom and constraints with coupled electrons, photons, and atomic structures. Properties that emerge from correlations between these atomic, electronic and photonic phenomena determine the intermediate length and time scales that can be exploited in applications ranging from quantum information to photocatalysis, and for the design of novel functional materials with tailored optoelectronic properties.\nIn particular, electron-photon, electron-electron as well as electron-phonon dynamics and far-from-equilibrium transport are critical to describe ultrafast and excited-state optoelectronic interactions in materials. Therefore, we are working on new and efficient theory methods to calculate arbitrary electron-phonon and electron-optical interactions in a Feynman diagram many-body framework integrated with a nonequilibrium carrier transport method.\nUnderstanding and Controling Collective Excitations of Photons, Phonons, and Electrons. # A major thrust of our research considers the question of creating new states of matter by driving it out of equilibrium. Such novel states of matter can have unexpected \u0026ndash; and useful \u0026ndash; properties, including surprisingly long coherence times and propagation lengths, allowing the tailoring of quantum properties for given applications. A common approach is to optically drive materials out of equilibrium, but today’s methods for studying optically driven systems are insufficient for revealing underlying mechanisms.\nAlthough time-dependent density-functional theory allows us, at least in principle, to study these properties, current approximations are almost exclusively bound to the adiabatic approximation and focus on electronic excitations, neglecting e.g., electron-phonon effects. This approximation limits the applicability of these methods to quantum applications, which requires understanding the coupled dynamics of electronic spins, nuclei, phonons and photons.\nTo address these problems, we recently introduced a method to predict new states of quantum matter with strong light-matter coupling via a new computational method, quantum electrodynamical density functional theory. This ab initio QED approach involves an exact reformulation of the Schrödinger equation that draws on two prominent theories in physics: quantum electrodynamics and electronic structure theory. This method treats electrons, photons and phonons on the same quantized footing and is, therefore, not restricted to few-level approximations commonly invoked in quantum optics, allowing us to study correlated electron-photon and photon-phonon dynamics, as we have recently demonstrated. Going forward, we intend to use this computational method to provide design principles on optically controlling, manipulating and using the properties of coherent quantum states.\nOpen Quantum Systems # Efficient control and design of many quantum technologies requires coupling to the control field while minimizing the detrimental effects of the environment. This competition implies that an understanding of a quantum system as open to its environment is critical to accurately understanding quantum processes. One research focus of the NarangLab is developing and improving the efficient treatment of open quantum systems in the presence of complex, non-Markovian environments. Building noise models beyond the Markovian regime has the potential to lead to improvements in quantum computation, communication, and sensing.\n","date":"23 June 2022","permalink":"/research/excited-state-dynamics/","section":"Research Topics","summary":"Challenge and Opportunity # Excited-state nanophotonics presents a critical challenge and opportunity as it involves competing degrees of freedom and constraints with coupled electrons, photons, and atomic structures.","title":"Excited State Dynamics and Open Quantum Systems"},{"content":" Quantum Nature of Light # Chemical reactions are ubiquitous and play a critical role in everyday life. From biological processes and sustainable energy sources, to drug design, scientists across fields seek to optimize the efficiency of the underlying chemical processes. Recent research at the interface of chemistry and cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) has surged and opened a new avenue for catalysis, using the quantum nature of light-molecule interactions to drive chemical reactions. One of the long-term goals of our group is to transform the field of catalysis by understanding and controlling chemical dynamics via quantum photonic platforms. Many key theoretical challenges remain for QED chemistry. Therefore we are working to create a new theoretical and computational method, combining concepts from theoretical chemistry, chemical physics and quantum electrodynamics. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recent paper from our group on cavity-correlated electron-nuclear dynamics, demonstrated for a CO2 molecule.\nQuantum plasmonics, plasmonic hot carriers, and single molecule-cavity hybrids. # The field of quantum plasmonics and plasmonic hot carriers is poised to deliver new quantum devices at the boundary of molecular electronics and quantum optics. Recent developments in quantum plasmonics have shown the ability of surface plasmons to preserve many key quantum mechanical properties of the photons used to excite them, notably entanglement, interferometry and sub-Poissonian statistics. These demonstrations inspire questions in many-body physics of collective excitations and point the way to ultrafast out-of-equilibrium concepts, both directions that the group is pursuing. Beyond catalysis, we envision single molecule-optical cavity hybrids as potential building blocks to create novel platforms for implementing specific quantum algorithms and simulations.

At the hardware level we work on many of the most promising quantum computing technologies - from the well established super-conducting platforms to photonic architectures with their promise of faster, potentially room-temperature devices - in collaboration with partners across industry and academia. Higher up the quantum technology stack, we work on quantum firmware-level circuit optimization and compilation tasks, while at the software level our work on classical preprocessing enables fruitful utilization of otherwise limited near term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum hardware.\nProf. Narang’s newly developed class (ES 170, Quantum Engineering) at Harvard covers many of these topics in an immediate and practical fashion, and uses IBM\u0026rsquo;s open-source quantum platforms to run NISQ algorithms and simulate molecules and materials. Course materials are readily available at request.\nQuantum building blocks and hardware # Optical quantum hardware promises much higher clock-rates compared to more mature platforms, as well as the potential to work at non-cryogenic temperatures. However, it also faces challenges due to the difficulty to create nonlinear interactions between photonic qubits. The group is exploring multiple lines of attack to these challenges, including the design of novel quantum defects, exotic vacancies in diamond lattices, and strongly nonlinear optical materials. At the same time, we are exploring quantum control schemes and corresponding bosonic error correcting codes that simplify the material requirements for such devices.\nQuantum compilation and circuit optimization # In the era of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum computers, we expect to see quantum devices with increasing numbers of qubits emerge. However, the connectivity between qubits will remain restricted, necessitating careful allocation of quantum registers to avoid costly operations, moving qubits between sparsely connected regions of the quantum chip. In the NarangLab we are developing compilation and circuit-optimization classical algorithms to optimize this allocation task, enabling the use of the hardware for otherwise prohibitive tasks.\nAlgorithms for small quantum devices # QAOA, VQE and other variational quantum-classical quantum algorithms have gained a great deal of attention as some of the most promising algorithms able to be run on near-term noisy quantum devices. However, improperly chosen initialization parameters for these algorithms can severely hamper their performance. By employing both classical and quantum optimization techniques for the pre- and post-processing steps, we develop methods to significantly improve the performance of these hybrid algorithms.\n","date":"23 June 2022","permalink":"/research/quantum-information-science/","section":"Research Topics","summary":"Our work in the quantum information subfield follows the integrated approach to quantum science embodied in the NarangLab.","title":"Quantum Information Science"},{"content":"We have an active effort on how to model quantum defects in solids (\u0026ldquo;artificial atoms in solids\u0026rdquo;) such that we can guide the development of next-generation scalable quantum systems.

Materials are known to be topological when their electronic band structures show mathematical properties that can be linked to quantized electronic responses. In a wide range of chemical compounds, the low-energy behavior is readily explained by topological field theories that provide a high-level approach to understand many exotic material properties. Many of these material systems have been theoretically identified and experimentally verified to exhibit topological properties.\nTopological materials can exhibit unusual electronic properties with analogs in high-energy physics. Among them, Weyl semimetals are promising candidates for future device applications due to their striking transport features. In candidate materials such as TaAs, NbAs, TaP and NbP, extremely high carrier mobilities and giant magnetoresistance have been reported. Our work puts a focus on the parameter-free prediction of optical and transport coefficients in these structures by developing new theoretical approaches. To model these systems at scale, we recently received a DOE INCITE Award on “Exascale Simulation of Topological Materials Dynamics” in 2020-21.\nIn collaboration with Prof. Dr. Claudia Felser and her team at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids, we have combined theoretical, computational and experimental efforts on Weyl semimetals to uncover the unique electronic, optoelectronic and transport properties of these materials.

We treat the anisotropic Fermi surface explicitly to numerically obtain experimentally-accessible transport observables, which bridge between the “diffusive,” “ballistic,” and “hydrodynamic” transport regime limits. We illustrate that the distinction between the “quasiballistic” and “quasihydrodynamic” regimes is challenging and often needs to be quantitative in nature. From first-principles calculations, we populate the resulting transport regime plots and demonstrate how the Fermi surface orientation adds complexity to the observed transport signatures in micrometer-scale devices.
